## Quick Development with Jade & Sass

This slide deck was used to present some larger concepts of Jade & Sass to the attendees of Minnebar 2016.

It was built using [Hakim El Tattab](https://github.com/hakimel)'s excellent [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework.

Basic navigation is: Hit the down arrow until you can't hit the down arrow no more, then hit the right arrow.
Alternatively, just hit spacebar.
Escape will give you a zoomed out view.
